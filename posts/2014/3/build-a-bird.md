Over a few nights while my wife was reading, I built a [Flappy Bird clone... maker](http://build-a-bird.tumblr.com/).

Paste in some links to images hosted elsewhere, and get a link to your version of the game. It's a fun, infuriating game. In that, it's authentic to the Flappy Bird experience.

It's been a while since I've made a game of any sort, and I've never made one for the web. This was an experiment of sorts, but it was definitely amusing. It works decently on most iOS devices, though I haven't tested it in many browsers.

Anyways, check it out, share your creations, and let me know what you think by posting with the hashtag [\#buildabird](https://tagboard.com/buildabird/160776).
